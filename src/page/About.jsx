                        I have strong experience in using programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a little basic PHP and I can also work with some frameworks that I am good at such as Bootstrap, React JS, React Native, and a little understanding of Laravel. I also understand the basic concepts of responsive design and interface design.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        First time I became interested in programming languages when I was in Junior High School and at that time I watched a movie titled Who Am I after this I was interested and wanted to be a hacker hehe.ü§£ So I started to find out how to learn programming language when I was a bachelor's degree student at Pamulang University (2017) I chose major in informatics of technic and the first language that I knew was C++ until the fourth semester I found a YouTube channel Web Programming UNPAS that provides education regarding basic languages such as HTML CSS PHP and Javascript.

                    <p>
                        First project was at that time creating a static web portfolio using HTML CSS and javascript. and while studying in 2022, for the first time I worked in the web developer section to build a social website the Gerakan Infaq Nutrisi, starting from UI design using Figma and then slicing to code HTML, CSS, and Javascript. At the time I build this website, I use the Laravel framework. But this project has not been resumed until now from my office.

                    <p>
                        For my undergraduate finals, I created an Android-based crowdfunding app using React Native. Before that I didn't really understand React until I found a bootcamp class on Build with Angga regarding creating an Android Food Market application that uses React Native for mobile applications and Laravel as a Content Management System and I was able to complete this class.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I find out about React, read about documents, and always try it in my simple project. and I continue my study case to make Android Application for my final undergraduate exams and about six months I finished this project.ü¶æ‚öîÔ∏è
